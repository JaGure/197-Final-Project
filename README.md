# 197-Final-Project
A virtual way to keep track of your DnD characters.

Users can sign up and then log in via the respective pages. Once logged in, a user is presented with
all of the current groups that they are in. They also have the option to create a group. Users can
access their created groups to see their character (if they have created it). If not, they have the
ability to create a very basic DnD character using information from this api: http://www.dnd5eapi.co/docs/.

The bulk of the code is in the client and routes folders. The frontend is all done in client. Most of the
server code is in routes, notably all of the database interaction is done in the files in this folder.
